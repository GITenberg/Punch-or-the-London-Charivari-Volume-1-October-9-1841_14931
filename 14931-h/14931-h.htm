<p>&ldquo;In the king&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p>Let fall your swords and daggers.&rdquo;&mdash;CRITIC.</p>

<p><span class="hide">A</span> melo-drama is a theatrical dose in
two or three acts, according to the strength of the constitution of
the audience. Its component parts are a villain, a lover, a
heroine, a comic character, and an executioner. These having
simmered and macerated through all manner of events, are strained
off together into the last scene; and the effervescence which then
ensues is called the <em>d&eacute;nouement</em>, and the
<em>d&eacute;nouement</em> is the soul of the drama.</p>
<p><em>D&eacute;nouements</em> are of three kinds:&mdash;The
natural, the unnatural, and the supernatural.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;natural&rdquo; is achieved when no probabilities are
violated;&mdash;that is, when the circumstances are such as really
might occur&mdash;if we could only bring ourselves to think
so&mdash;as, (<em>ex. gr.</em>)</p>
<p>When the villain, being especially desirous to preserve and
secrete certain documents of vital importance to himself and to the
piece, does, most unaccountably, mislay them in the most
conspicuous part of the stage, and straightway they are found by
the very last member of the <em>dram. pers.</em> in whose hands he
would like to see them.</p>
<p>When the villain and his accomplice, congratulating each other
on the successful issue of their crimes, and dividing the spoil
thereof (which they are always careful to do in a loud voice, and
in a room full of closets), are suddenly set upon and secured by
the innocent yet suspected and condemned parties, who are at that
moment passing on their way to execution.</p>
<p>When the guiltless prisoner at the bar, being asked for his
defence, and having no witnesses to call, produces a checked
handkerchief, and subpoenas his own conscience, which has such an
effect on the villain, that he swoons, and sees demons in the
jury-box, and tells them that &ldquo;he is ready,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;he comes,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>When the deserter, being just about to be shot, is miraculously
saved by his mistress, who cuts the matter very fine indeed, by
rushing in between &ldquo;present&rdquo; and &ldquo;fire;&rdquo;
and, having ejaculated &ldquo;a reprieve!&rdquo; with all her
might, falls down, overcome by fatigue&mdash;poor dear! as well she
may&mdash;having run twenty-three miles in the changing of a scene,
and carried her baby on her arm all the blessed way, in order to
hold him up in the tableau at the end.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;Whenever married people rescue one another as above,
the &ldquo;<em>d&eacute;nouement</em>&rdquo; belongs to the class
&ldquo;unnatural;&rdquo; which is used when the author wishes to
show the intensity of his invention&mdash;as, (<em>ex. gr.</em>
again)</p>
<p>When an old man, having been wounded fatally by a young man,
requests, as a boon, to be permitted to examine the young
man&rsquo;s neck, who, accordingly unloosing his cravat, displays a
hieroglyphic neatly engraved thereon, which the old man interprets
into his being a parricide, and then dies, leaving the young man in
a state of histrionic stupor.</p>
<p>When a will is found embellished with a Daguerr&eacute;otype of
four fingers and a thumb, done in blood on the cover, and it turns
out that the residuary legatee is no better than he should
be&mdash;but, on the contrary, a murderer nicely ripe for
killing.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;supernatural&rdquo; <em>d&eacute;nouement</em> is the
last resource of a bewildered dramatist, and introduces either an
individual in green scales and wings to match, who gives the
audience to understand that he is a fiend, and that he has private
business to transact below with the villain; who, accordingly,
withdraws in his company, with many throes and groans, down the
trap.</p>
<p>Or a pale ghost in dingy lawn, apparently afflicted with a
serious haemorrhage in the bosom, who appears to a great many
people, running, in dreams; and at last joins the hands of the
young couple, and puts in a little plea of her own for a private
burial.</p>
<p>And there are many other variations of the three great classes
of <em>d&eacute;nouements</em>; such as the helter-skelter
nine-times-round-the-stage-combat, and the grand
<em>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</em> in which everybody kills everybody
else, and leaves the piece to be carried on by their executors; but
we dare unveil the mystery no further.</p>

<h3>SPORTING FACE.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Roebuck to O&rsquo;Connell,
&ldquo;despite Peel&rsquo;s double-face propensities, he is a great
genius.&rdquo; &ldquo;A great <em>Janus</em> indeed,&rdquo;
answered the <em>liberathor</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>&ldquo;A RING! A RING!!&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The political pugilistic scrimmage which recently took place in
the House of Congress so completely coincides with the views and
propensities of the &ldquo;universal scrimmage&rdquo; member for
Bath, that he intends making a motion for the erection of a
twenty-four-foot-ring on the floor of the House, for the benefit of
opposition members. The Speaker, says Roebuck, will, in that case,
be enabled to ascertain whether the &ldquo;noes&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ayes&rdquo; have it, without tellers.</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S GUIDE TO THE WATERING PLACES.&mdash;No. 1.</h2>
<h3>BRIGHTON</h3>
<p>If you are either in a great hurry, or tired of life, book
yourself by the Brighton railroad, and you are ensured one of two
things&mdash;arrival in two hours, or destruction by that rapid
process known in America as &ldquo;immortal smash,&rdquo; which
brings you to the end of your journey before you get to the
terminus. Should you fortunately meet with the former result, and
finish your trip without ending your mortal career, you find the
place beset with cads and omnibuses, which are very convenient; for
if your hotel or boarding-house be at the extremity of the town,
you would have to walk at least half a mile but for such vehicles,
and they only charge sixpence, with the additional advantage of the
great chance of your luggage being lost. If you be a married man,
you will go to an hotel where you can get a bed for half-a-guinea a
night, provided you do not want it warmed, and use your own soap;
but it is five shillings extra if you do. Should you be a bachelor,
or an old maid, you, of course, put up at a boarding-house, where
you see a great deal of good society at two guineas a week; for
every third man is a captain, and every fifth woman &ldquo;my
lady.&rdquo; There, too, you observe a continual round of courtship
going on; for it comes in with the coffee, and continues during
every meal. &ldquo;Marriages,&rdquo; it is said, &ldquo;are made in
heaven&rdquo;&mdash;good matches are always got up at meal-times in
Brighton boarding-houses.</p>
<p>Brighton is decidedly a fishing-town, for besides the quantity
of John Dorys caught there, it is a celebrated place for pursey
half-pay officers to angle in for rich widows. The bait they
generally use consists of dyed whiskers, and a distant relationship
to some of the &ldquo;gentles&rdquo; or nobles of the land. The
town itself is built upon <em>the downs</em>&mdash;a series of
hills, which those in the habit of walking over them are apt to
call &ldquo;ups and downs.&rdquo; It consists entirely of hotels,
boarding-houses, and bathing-machines, with a pavilion and a
chain-pier. The amusements are various, and of a highly
intellectual character: the chief of them being a walk from the
esplanade to the east cliff, and a promenade back again from the
east cliff to the esplanade. Donkey-races are in full vogue,
insomuch that the highways are thronged with interesting animals,
decorated with serge-trappings and safety-saddles, and interspersed
with goat-carts and hired flys. There is a library, where the
visiters do everything but read; and a theatre, where&mdash;as
Charles Kean is now playing there&mdash;they do anything but act.
The ladies seem to take great delight in the sea-bath, and that
they may enjoy the luxury in the most secluded privacy, the
machines are placed as near to the pier as possible. This is always
crowded with men, who, by the aid of opera glasses, find it a
pleasing pastime to watch the movements of the delicate Naiads who
crowd the waters.</p>
<p>Those to whom Brighton is recommended for change of air and of
scene get sadly taken in, for here the air&mdash;like that of a
barrel-organ&mdash;never changes, as the wind is always high. In
sunshine, Brighton always looks hot; in moonshine, eternally
dreary; the men are yawning all day long, and the women sitting
smirking in bay-windows, or walking with puppy-dogs and parasols,
which last they are continually opening and shutting. In short,
when a man is sick of the world, or a maiden of forty-five has been
so often crossed in love as to be obliged to leave off hoping
against hope, Brighton is an excellent place to prepare him or her
for a final retirement from life&mdash;whether that is contemplated
in the Queen&rsquo;s Bench, a convent, a residence among the Welsh
mountains, or the monastery of La Trappe, a month&rsquo;s probation
in Brighton, at the height of the season, being well calculated to
make any such change not only endurable, but agreeable.</p>

<h2>THE HEIR OF APPLEBITE.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<h4>TREATS OF CHALK-AND-QUA-DRILL-OGY.</h4>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/013-02.png"><img src=

"A shepherd sits under a tree, forming a letter E." id="img013-02"

<p><span class="hide">E</span>ntirely disgusted with his
unsuccessful appeal to the enlightened British public assembled in
the front of his residence, and which had produced effects so
contrary to what he had conceived would be the result, Agamemnon
called a committee of his household, to determine on the most
advisable proceedings to be adopted for remedying the evils
resulting from the unexpected pyrotechnic display of the morning.
The carpet was spoiled&mdash;the house was impregnated with the
sooty effluvia, and the company was expected to arrive at nine
o&rsquo;clock. What was to be done? Betty suggested the burning of
brown paper and scrubbing the carpet; John, assaf&oelig;tida and
sawdust; Mrs. Waddledot, pastilles and chalking the floor. As the
latter remedies seemed most compatible with the gentility of their
expected visiters, immediate measures were taken for carrying them
into effect. A dozen cheese-plates were disposed upon the stairs,
each furnished with little pyramids of fragrance; old John, who was
troubled with an asthma, was deputed to superintend them, and
nearly coughed himself into a fit of apoplexy in the strenuous
discharge of his duty.</p>
<p>Whilst these in-door remedial appliances were in progress,
Agamemnon was hurrying about in a hack cab to discover a designer
in chalk, and at length was fortunate enough to secure the
&ldquo;own artist&rdquo; of the celebrated &ldquo;Crown and
Anchor.&rdquo; Mr. Smear was a shrewd man, as well as an excellent
artist; and when he perceived the very peculiar position of things,
he forcibly enumerated all the difficulties which presented
themselves, and which could only be surmounted by a large increase
of remuneration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Smear, &ldquo;that wherever
that ere water <em>has</em> been it&rsquo;s left a dampness ahind
it; the moistur&rsquo; consekent upon such a dampness must be
evaporated by ever-so-many applications of the warming-pan. The
steam which a rises from this hoperation, combined with the extra
hart required to hide them two black spots in the middle, will make
the job come to one-pund-one, independently of the
chalk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agamemnon had nothing left but compliance with Mr. Smear&rsquo;s
demand; and one warming and three stew-pans, filled with live
coals, were soon engaged in what Mr. Smear called the
&ldquo;ewaporating department.&rdquo; As soon as the boards were
sufficiently dry, Mr. Smear commenced operations. In each of the
four corners of the room he described the diagram of a coral and
bells, connecting them with each other by graceful festoons of
blue-chalk ribbon tied in large true-lover&rsquo;s knots in the
centre. Having thus completed a frame, he proceeded, after sundry
contortions of the facial muscles, to the execution of the great
design. Having described an ellipse of red chalk, he tastefully
inserted within it a perfect representation of the interior of an
infant&rsquo;s mouth in an early stage of dentition, whilst a
graceful letter <em>A</em> seemed to keep the gums apart to allow
of this artistical exhibition. Proudly did Mr. Smear cast his small
grey eyes on Agamemnon, and challenge him, as it were, to a
laudatory acknowledgment of his genius; but as his patron remained
silent, Mr. Smear determined to speak out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hart has done her best&mdash;language must do the rest. I
am now only awaiting for the motter. What shall I say,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Welcome&rsquo; is as good as anything, in my
opinion,&rdquo; replied Collumpsion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; ejaculated Smear: &ldquo;a servile
himitation of a general &rsquo;lumination idea, sir. We must be
original. Will you leave it to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; said Agamemnon. And with many inward
protestations against parties in general and his own in particular,
he left Mr. Smear and his imagination together.</p>
<p>The great artist in chalk paced the room for some minutes, and
then slapped his left thigh, in confirmation of the existence of
some brilliant idea. The result was soon made apparent on the
boards of the drawing-room, where the following inscription
attested the immensity of Smear&rsquo;s genius&mdash;</p>
<p class="cen">"PARTAKE<br />
OF<br />
OUR<br />
DENTAL DELIGHT."</p>
<p>The guinea was instantly paid; but Collumpsion was for a length
of time in a state of uncertainty as to whether Mr. Smear&rsquo;s
talents were ornamental or disfigurative. Nine o&rsquo;clock
arrived, and with it a rumble of vehicles, and an agitation of
knocker, that were extremely exhilarating to the heretofore
exhausted and distressed family at 24.</p>
<p>We shall not attempt to particularise the arrivals, as they were
precisely the same set as our readers have invariably met at routs
of the second class for these last five years. There was the young
gentleman in an orange waistcoat, bilious complexion, and hair
<em>&agrave; la Petrarch</em>, only gingered; and so also were the
two Misses &mdash;&mdash;, in blue gauze, looped up with
coral,&mdash;and that fair-haired girl who &ldquo;detethted
therry,&rdquo; and those black eyes, whose lustrous beauty made
such havoc among the untenanted hearts of the youthful
beaux;&mdash;but, reader, you <em>must</em> know the set that
<em>must</em> have visited the Applebites.</p>
<p>All went &ldquo;merry as a marriage bell,&rdquo; and we feel
that we cannot do better than assist future commentators by giving
a minute analysis of a word which so frequently occurs in the
fashionable literature of the present day that doubtlessly in after
time many anxious inquiries and curious conjectures would be
occasioned, but for the service we are about to confer on posterity
(for the pages of PUNCH are immortal) by a description of</p>
<h5>A QUADRILLE:</h5>
<p>which is a dance particularly fashionable in the nineteenth
century. In order to render our details perspicuous and lucid, we
will suppose&mdash;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>&mdash;A gentleman in tight pantaloons and a tip.</li>
<li>&mdash;Ditto in loose ditto, and a camellia japonica in the
button-hole of his coat.</li>
<li>&mdash;Ditto in a crimson waistcoat, and a pendulating
eye-glass.</li>
<li>&mdash;Ditto in violent wristbands, and an alarming eruption of
buttons.</li>
</ol>
<h6>ALSO,</h6>
<ol type="1">
<li>&mdash;A young lady in pink-gauze and freckles.</li>
<li>&mdash;Ditto in book-muslin and marabouts.</li>
<li>&mdash;Ditto with blonde and a slight cast.</li>
<li>&mdash;Ditto in her 24th year, and black satin.</li>
</ol>
<p>The four gentlemen present themselves to the four ladies, and
having smirked and &ldquo;begged the honour,&rdquo; the four pairs
take their station in the room in the following order:</p>
<table summary="quadrille setting" style="width:80%;margin:auto;">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td style="text-align:center;">The tip and the freckles.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;">The camelia japonica, and the
marabouts.</td>
<td></td>
<td style="text-align:center;">The crimson waistcoat, and the
slight cast.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td style="text-align:center;">The violent wristbands and the black
satin.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>During eight bars of music, tip, crimson, camellia, and
wristbands, bow to freckles, slight cast, marabouts, and black
satin, who curtsey in return, and then commence</p>
<h5>LA PANTALON,</h5>
<p>by performing an intersecting figure that brings all parties
exactly where they were; which joyous circumstance is celebrated by
bobbing for four bars opposite to each other, and then indulging in
a universal twirl which apparently offends the ladies, who seize
hold of each other&rsquo;s hands only to leave go again, and be
twirled round by the opposite gentleman, who, having secured his
partner, promenades her half round to celebrate his victory, and
then returns to his place with his partner, performing a similar
in-and-out movement as that which commenced <em>la
Pantalon</em>.</p>
<h5>L&rsquo;ETE</h5>
<p>is a much more respectful operation. Referring to our previous
arrangement, wristbands and freckles would advance and
retire&mdash;then they would take two hops and a jump to the right,
then two hops and a jump to the left&mdash;then cross over, and
there hop and jump the same number of times and come back again,
and having celebrated their return by bobbing for four bars, they
twirl their partners again, and commence</p>
<h5>LA POULE.</h5>
<p>The crimson waistcoat and marabouts would shake hands with their
right, and then cross over, and having shaken hands again with the
left, come back again. They then would invite the camellia and the
slight cast to join them, and perform a kind of wild Indian dance
&ldquo;all of a row.&rdquo; After which they all walk to the sides
they have no business upon, and then crimson runs round marabout,
and taking his partner&rsquo;s hand, <em>i.e.</em>, the slight
cast, introduces her to camellia and marabout, as though they had
never met before. This introduction is evidently disagreeable, for
they instantly retire, and then rush past each other, as furiously
as they can, to their respective places.</p>
<h5>LA TRENISE</h5>
<p>is evidently intended to &ldquo;trot out&rdquo; the dancers.
Freckles and black satin shake hands as they did in <em>la
Pantalon</em>, and then freckles trots tip out <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span>twice,
and crosses over to the opposite side to have a good look at him;
having satisfied her curiosity, she then, in company with black
satin, crosses over to have a stare at the violent wristbands, in
contrast with tip who wriggles over, and join him, and then,
without saying a word to each other, bob, and are twirled as in
<em>l&rsquo;Et&eacute;</em>.</p>
<h5>LA PASTORALE</h5>
<p>seems to be an inversion of <em>la Trenise</em>, except that in
nineteen cases out of twenty, the waistcoat, tip, camellia and
wristbands, seem to undergo intense mental torture; for if there be
such a thing as &ldquo;poetry of motion,&rdquo; <em>pastorale</em>
must be the &ldquo;Inferno of Dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<h5>LA FINALE</h5>
<p>commences with a circular riot, which leads to
<em>l&rsquo;Et&eacute;</em>. The ladies then join hands, and
endeavour to imitate the graceful evolutions of a windmill,
occasionally grinding the corns of their partners, who frantically
rush in with the quixotic intention of stopping them. A general
shuffling about then takes place, which terminates in a bow, a bob,
and &ldquo;allow me to offer you some refreshment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Malheureux!</em> we have devoted so much space to the
quadrille, that we have left none for the supper, which being a
cold one, will keep till next week.</p>

<h2>THE GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S OWN BOOK.</h2>
<p>We are ashamed to ask our readers to refer to our last article
under the title of the &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Own Book,&rdquo;
for the length of time which has elapsed almost accuses us of
disinclination for our task, or weariness in catering for the
amusement of our subscribers. But September&mdash;September, with
all its allurements of flood and field&mdash;its gathering of
honest old friends&mdash;its tales of by-gone seasons, and its
glorious promises of the present&mdash;must plead our apology for
abandoning our pen and rushing back to old associations, which
haunt us like</p>

<p>THE SPELLS OF CHILDHOOD.</p>
</div>
<p>We know that we are forgiven, so shall proceed at once to the
consideration of the ornaments and pathology of coats.</p>
<h3>THE ORNAMENTS</h3>
<p>are those parts of the external decorations which are intended
either to embellish the person or garment, or to notify the
pecuniary superiority of the wearer. Amongst the former are to be
included buttons, braids, and mustachios; amongst the latter,
chains, rings, studs, canes, watches, and above all, those pocket
talismans, purses. There are also riding-whips and spurs, which may
be considered as <em>implying</em> the possession of quadrupedal
property.</p>
<p><em>Of Buttons</em>.&mdash;In these days of
innovation&mdash;when Brummagem button-makers affect a taste and
elaboration of design&mdash;a true gentleman should be most careful
in the selection of this <em>dulce et utile</em> contrivance.
Buttons which resemble gilt acidulated drops, or ratafia cakes, or
those which are illustrative of the national emblems&mdash;the
rose, shamrock, and thistle tied together like a bunch of faded
watercresses, or those which are commemorative of coronations,
royal marriages, births, and christenings, chartist liberations,
the success of liberal measures, and such like occasions, or those
which would serve for vignettes for the <em>Sporting Magazine</em>,
or those which at a distance bear some resemblance to the royal
arms, but which, upon closer inspection, prove to be bunches of
endive, surmounted by a crown which the Herald&rsquo;s College does
not recognise, or those which have certain letters upon them, as
the initials of clubs which are never heard of in St.
James&rsquo;s, as the U.S.C.&mdash;the Universal Shopmen&rsquo;s
Club; T.Y.C.&mdash;the Young Tailors&rsquo; Club; L.S.D.&mdash;the
Linen Drapers&rsquo; Society&mdash;and the like. All these are to
be fashionably eschewed. The regimental, the various hunts, the
yacht clubs, and the basket pattern, are the only buttons of
Birmingham birth which can be allowed to associate with the
button-holes of a gentleman.</p>
<p>The restrictions on silk buttons are confined chiefly to
magnitude. They must not be so large as an opera ticket, nor so
small as a silver penny.</p>
<p><em>Of Braids</em>.&mdash;This ornament, when worn in the
street, is patronised exclusively by Polish refugees, theatrical
Jews, opera-dancers, and boarding-house fortune-hunters.</p>
<p><em>Of Mustachios</em>.&mdash;The mustachio depends for its
effect entirely upon its adaptation to the expression of the
features of the wearer. The small, or <em>moustache &agrave; la
chinoise</em>, should only appear in conjunction with Tussaud, or
waxwork complexions, and then only provided the teeth are
excellent; for should the dental conformation be of the same tint,
the mustachios would only provoke observation. The German, or full
hearth-brush, should be associated with what Mr. Ducrow would
designate a &ldquo;cream,&rdquo; and everybody else a drab
countenance, and should never be resorted to, except in conformity
with regimental requisitions, or for the capture of an Irish widow,
as they are generally indigenous to Boulogne and the Bench, and are
known amongst tailors and that class of clothier victims as
&ldquo;bad debts,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the insolvency
regulation,&rdquo; and operate with them as an insuperable bar
to</p>

<p>PASSING A BILL.</p>
</div>
<p>The perfect, or heart-meshes, are those in which each particular
hair has its particular place, and must be of a silky texture, and
not of a bristly consistency, like a worn-out tooth-brush. Neither
must they be of a bright red, bearing a striking resemblance to two
young spring radishes.</p>
<p>The <em>barbe au bonc</em>, or <em>Muntzian fringe</em>, should
only be worn when a gentleman is desirous of obtaining notoriety,
and prefers trusting to his external embellishments in preference
to his intellectual acquirements.</p>
<p><em>On Tips</em>.&mdash;Tips are an abomination to which no
gentleman can lend his countenance. They are a shabby and mangy
compromise for mustachios, and are principally sported by the genus
of clerks, who, having strong hirsute predilections, small
salaries, and sober-minded masters, hang a tassel on the chin
instead of a vallance on the upper lip.</p>
<p>Our space warns us to conclude, and, as a fortnight&rsquo;s
indolence is not the strongest stimulant to exertion, we willingly
drop our pen, and taking the hint and a cigar, indulge in a
voluminous cloud, and a lusty</p>

<h3>&ldquo;HABIT IS SECOND NATURE.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>FEARGUS O&rsquo;CONNOR always attends public meetings, dressed
in a complete suit of fustian. He could not select a better emblem
of his writings in the <em>Northern Star</em>, than the material he
has chosen for his habiliments.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;SAY IT WAS ME.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Jem! you rascal, get up! get up, and be hanged to you,
sir; don&rsquo;t you hear somebody hammering and pelting away at
the street-door knocker, like the ghost of a dead postman with a
tertian ague! Open it! see what&rsquo;s the matter, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; responded the tame tiger of the excited
and highly respectable Adolphus Casay, shiveringly emerging from
beneath the bed-clothes he had diligently wrapped round his aching
head, to deaden the incessant clamour of the iron which was
entering into the soul of his sleep. A hastily-performed toilet, in
which the more established method of encasing the lower man with
the front of the garment to the front of the wearer, was curiously
reversed, and the capture of the left slipper, which, as the
weakest goes to the wall, the right foot had thrust itself into,
was scarcely effected, ere another series of knocks at the door,
and batch of invectives from Mr. Adolphus Casay, hurried the
partial sacrificer to the Graces, at a Derby pace, over the cold
stone staircase, to discover the cause of the confounded uproar.
The door was opened&mdash;a confused jumble of unintelligible
mutterings aggravated the eager ears of the shivering Adolphus.
Losing all patience, he exclaimed, in a tone of thunder&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, you villain? Can&rsquo;t you
speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, in course I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you, you imp of mischief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-going to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it at once&mdash;let me know the worst. Is it fire,
murder, or thieves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, sir; it&rsquo;s A1, with a dark
lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, in the name of persecution and the new police, does
A1, with a dark lantern, want with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, Mr. Brown Bunkem has give him
half-a-crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you little ruffian, what&rsquo;s that to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, he guv it him to come here, and ask
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here policeman A1, with the dark lantern, took up the
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jist to step down to the station-&rsquo;us, and bail him
therefrom&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being werry drunk&mdash;uncommon overcome,
surely&mdash;and oudacious obstropelous.&rdquo; continued the
alphabetically and numerically-distinguished conservator of the
public peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a werry heavily-laden stretcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce take the mad fool,&rdquo; muttered the
disturbed housekeeper; then added, in a louder tone, &ldquo;Ask the
policeman in, and request him to take&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything you please, sir; it is rather a cold night, but
as we&rsquo;re all in a hurry, suppose it&rsquo;s something short,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the original proposition, commencing with the word
&ldquo;take,&rdquo; was meant by its propounder to achieve its
climax in &ldquo;a seat on one of the hall chairs;&rdquo; but the
liquid inferences of A1, with a dark lantern, had the desired
effect, and induced a command from Mr. Adolphus Casay to the small
essential essence of condensed valetanism in the person of Jim
Pipkin, to produce the case-bottles for the discussion of the said
A1, with the dark lantern, who gained considerably in the good
opinion of Mr. James Pipkin, by requesting the favour of his
company in the bibacious avocation he so much delighted in.</p>
<p>A1 having expressed a decided conviction that, anywhere but on
the collar of his coat, or the date of monthly imprisonments, his
distinguishing number was the most unpleasant and unsocial of the
whole multiplication table, further proceeded to illustrate his
remarks by proposing glasses two and three, to the great delight
and inebriation of the small James Pipkin, who was suddenly aroused
from a dreamy contemplation of two policemen, and increased service
of case-bottles and liquor-glasses, by a sound box on the ear, and
a stern command to retire to his own proper dormitory&mdash;the one
coming from the hand, the other from the lips, of his annoyed
master, who then and there departed, under the guidance of A1, with
the dark lantern. After passing various lanes and weary ways, the
station was reached, and there, in the full plenitude of glorious
drunkenness, lay his friend, the identical Mr. Brown Bunkem, who,
in the emphatic words of the inspector, was declared to be
&ldquo;just about as far gone as any gentleman&rsquo;s son need
wish to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the charge?&rdquo; commenced Mr. Adolphus
Casay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven shillings a bottle.&mdash;Take it out
o&rsquo;that, and d&mdash;n the expense,&rdquo; interposed and
hiccoughed the overtaken Brown Bunkem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drunk, disorderly, and very abusive,&rdquo; read the
inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to blazes!&rdquo; shouted Bunkem, and then commenced a
very vague edition of &ldquo;God save the Queen,&rdquo; which, by
some extraordinary &ldquo;sliding scale,&rdquo; finally developed
the last verse of &ldquo;Nix my Dolly,&rdquo; which again, at the
mention of the &ldquo;stone jug,&rdquo; flew off into a very
apocryphal version of the &ldquo;Bumper of Burgundy;&rdquo; the
lines &ldquo;upstanding, uncovered,&rdquo; appeared at once to
superinduce the opinion that greater effect would be given to his
performance by complying with both propositions. In attempting to
assume the perpendicular, Mr. Brown Bunkem was signally frustrated,
as the result was a more perfect development of his original
horizontal recumbency, assumed at the conclusion of a very vigorous
fall. To make up for this deficiency, the suggestion as to the
singer appearing uncovered, was achieved with more force than
propriety, by Mr. Brown Bunkem&rsquo;s nearly displacing several of
the inspector&rsquo;s front teeth, by a blow from his
violently-hurled hat at the head of that respectable
functionary.</p>
<p>What would have followed, it is impossible to say; but at this
moment Mr. Adolphus Casay&rsquo;s bail was accepted, he being duly
bound down, in the sum of twenty pounds, to produce Mr. Brown
Bunkem at the magistrate&rsquo;s office by eleven o&rsquo;clock of
the following forenoon. This being settled, in spite of a vigorous
opposition, with the assistance of five half-crowns, four
policemen, the driver of, and hackney-coach No. 3141, Mr. Brown
Bunkem was conveyed to his own proper lodgings, and there left,
with one boot and a splitting headache, to do duty for a
counterpane, he vehemently opposing every attempt to make him a
deposit between the sheets.&mdash;Seven o&rsquo;clock on the
following morning found Mr. Adolphus Casay at the bedside of the
violently-snoring and stupidly obfuscated Brown Bunkem. In vain he
pinched, shook, shouted, and swore; inarticulate grunts and
apoplectic denunciations against the disturber of his rest were the
only answers to his urgent appeals as to the necessity of Mr. Brown
Bunkem&rsquo;s getting ready to appear before the magistrate.
Visions of contempt of court, forfeited bail, and consequent
disbursements, flitted before the mind of the agitated Mr. Adolphus
Casay. Ten o&rsquo;clock came; Bunken seemed to snore the louder
and sleep the sounder. What was to be done? why, nothing but to get
up an impromptu influenza, and try his rhetoric on the presiding
magistrates of the bench.</p>
<p>Influenced by this determination, Mr. Adolphus Casay started for
that den of thieves and magistrates in the neighbourhood of
Bow-street; but Mr. Adolphus Casay&rsquo;s feelings were anything
but enviable; though by no means a straitlaced man, he had an
instinctive abhorrence of anything that appeared a blackguard
transaction. Nothing but a kind wish to serve a friend would have
induced him to appear within a mile of such a wretched place; but
the thing was now unavoidable, so he put the best face he could on
the matter, made his way to the clerk of the Court, and there, in a
low whisper, began his explanation, that being &ldquo;how Mr. Brown
Bunkem&rdquo;&mdash;at this moment the crier shouted&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bunkem! Where&rsquo;s Bunkem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here!&rdquo; said Mr. Adolphus Casay; &ldquo;here
to&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step inside, Bunkem,&rdquo; shouted a sturdy auxiliary;
and with considerable manual exertion and remarkable agility, he
gave the unfortunate Adolphus a peculiar twist that at once
deposited him behind the bar and before the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg to state,&rdquo; commenced the agitated and
innocent Adolphus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, prisoner!&rdquo; roared the crier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to say,&rdquo;&mdash;again commenced
Adolphus&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; vociferated P74.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must and will be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the magistrate, laying down the
paper, &ldquo;you are doing yourself no good; be quiet. Clerk, read
the charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some piano mumbling, the words
&ldquo;drunk&mdash;abusive&mdash;disorderly&mdash;incapable&mdash;taking
care of self&mdash;stretcher&mdash;station-house&mdash;bail,&rdquo;
were shouted out in the most fortissimo manner.</p>
<p>At the end of the reading, all eyes were directed to the
well-dressed and gentlemanly-looking Adolphus. He appeared to
excite universal sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to say, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, your worship, the charge is true;
but&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! never mind your buts. Will you ever appear in the
same situation again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul I won&rsquo;t; but&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, then, that will do; I like your sincerity, but
don&rsquo;t swear. Pay one shilling, and you are
discharged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will your worship allow me&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no time, sir. Next case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next case. Hold your jaw!&mdash;this
way!&rdquo;&mdash;and the same individual who had jerked Mr.
Adolphus Casay into the dock, rejerked him into the middle of the
court. The shilling was paid, and, amid the laughter of the idlers
at his anti-teetotal habits, he made the best of his way from the
scene of his humiliation. As he rushed round the corner of the
street, a peal of laughter struck upon his ears, and there, in full
feather, as sober as ever, stood Mr. Brown Bunkem, enjoying the
joke beyond all measure. Indignation took possession of Mr.
Adolphus Casay&rsquo;s bosom; he demanded to know the cause of this
strange conduct, stating that his character was for ever
compromised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; coolly rejoined the unmoved Bunkem;
&ldquo;we are all subject to accidents. You certainly were in a
scrape, but I think none the worse of you; and, if it&rsquo;s any
satisfaction, you may say it was me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it was you! Why it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital, upon my life! do you hear him, Smith, how well
he takes a cue? but stick to it, old fellow, I don&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;ll be believed; but&mdash;<em>say it was
me.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Brown Bunkem was perfectly right. Mr. Adolphus Casay was not
believed; for some time he told the story as it really was, but to
no purpose. The indefatigable Brown was always appealed to by
mutual friends, his answer invariably was&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <em>Casay&rsquo;s</em> a steady fellow, <em>I</em>
am not; it <em>might</em> injure him. <em>I</em> defy report;
therefore I gave him leave to&mdash;<em>say it was
me!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that was all the thanks Mr. Adolphus Casay ever got for
bailing friend.</p>

Whiggery to the College of St. Stephen&rsquo;s.</em></p>
<hr class="short" />
<h4>BOOK I.&mdash;DEFINITIONS.</h4>
<p>A point in politics is that which always has <em>place</em> (in
view,) but no particular party.</p>
<p>A line in politics is interest without principle.</p>
<p>The extremities of a line are loaves and fishes.</p>
<p>A right line is that which lies evenly between the Ministerial
and Opposition benches.</p>
<p>A superficies is that which professes to have principle, but has
no consistency.</p>
<p>The extremities of a superficies are expediencies.</p>
<p>A plain superficies is that of which two opposite speeches being
taken, the line between them evidently lies wholly in the direction
of Downing-street.</p>
<p>A plain angle is the evident inclination, and consequent
piscation, of a member for a certain place; or it is the meeting
together of two members who are not in the same line of
politics.</p>
<p>When a member sits on the cross benches, and shows no particular
inclination to one side or the other, it is called a right
angle.</p>
<p>An obtuse angle is that in which the inclination is
<em>evidently</em> to the Treasury.</p>
<p>An acute angle is that in which the inclination is
<em>apparently</em> to the Opposition benches.</p>
<p>A boundary is the extremity or whipper-in of any party.</p>
<p>A party is that which is kept together by one or more
whippers-in.</p>
<p>A circular member is a rum figure, produced by turning round;
and is such that all lines of politics centre in himself, and are
the same to him.</p>
<p>The diameter of a circular member is a line drawn on the
Treasury, and terminating in both pockets.</p>
<p>Trilateral members, or waverers, are those which have three
sides.</p>
<p>Of three-sided members an equilateral or independent member is
that to which all sides are the same.</p>
<p>An isosceles or vacillating member is that to which two sides
only are the same.</p>
<p>A scalene or scaly member has no one side which is equal to his
own interest.</p>
<p>Parallel lines of politics are such as are in the same
direction&mdash;say Downing-street; but which, being produced ever
so far&mdash;say to Windsor&mdash;do not meet.</p>
<p>A political problem is a Tory proposition, showing that the
country is to be done.</p>
<p>A theorem is a Whig proposition&mdash;the benefit of which to
any one but the Whigs always requires to be demonstrated.</p>
<p>A corollary is the consequent confusion brought about by
adopting the preceding Whig proposition.</p>
<p>A deduction is that which is drawn from the revenue by adopting
the preceding Whig proposition.</p>

<h3>MAJOR BENIOWSKY&rsquo;S NEW ART OF MEMORY</h3>
<p>A gentleman who boasts one of those proper names in <em>sky</em>
which are naturally enough transmitted &ldquo;from <em>pole to
pole</em>,&rdquo; undertakes to teach the art of remembering upon
entirely new principles. We know not what the merit of his
invention may be, but we beg leave to ask the <em>Major</em> a few
<em>general</em> questions, and we, therefore, respectfully inquire
whether his system would be capable of effecting the following
miracles:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. Would it be possible to make Sir James Graham remember that
he not long since declared his present colleagues to be men wholly
unworthy of public confidence?</p>
<p>2dly. Would Major Beniowsky&rsquo;s plan compel a man to
remember his tailor&rsquo;s bill; and, if so, would it go so far as
to remind him to call for the purpose of paying it?</p>
<p>3dly. Would the new system of memory enable Mr. Wakley to
refrain from forgetting himself?</p>
<p>4thly. Would the Phrenotypics, or brain-printing, as it is
called, succeed in stereotyping a pledge in the recollection of a
member of parliament?</p>
<p>5thly. Is it possible for the new art to cause Sir Robert Peel
to remember from one week to the other his political promises?</p>
<p>We fear these questions must be answered in the negative; but we
have a plan of our own for exercising the memory, which will beat
that of Beniow, or any other sky, who ventures to propose one. Our
proposition is, &ldquo;<em>Read</em> PUNCH,&rdquo; and we will be
bound that no one will ever forget it who has once enjoyed the
luxury.</p>

<h3>SHIPPING INTELLIGENCE.</h3>
<p>The <em>Shamrock</em> ran upon a timber-raft on Monday morning,
and was <em>off Deal</em> in ten minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>The storm of Thursday did considerable damage to the shipping in
the Thames. A coal was picked up off Vauxhall, which gave rise to a
report that a barge had gone down in the offing. On making
inquiries at Lloyd&rsquo;s, we asked what were the advices, when we
were advised to mind our own business, an answer we have too
frequently received from the underlings of that establishment. The
<em>Bachelor</em> has been telegraphed on its way up from Chelsea.
It is expected to bring the latest news relative to the gas-lights
on the Kensington-road, which, it is well known, are expected to
enjoy a disgraceful sinecure during the winter.</p>
<p>Captain Snooks, of the <em>Daffydowndilly</em>, committed
suicide by jumping down the chimney of the steamer under his
command. The rash act occasioned a momentary flare up, but did not
impede the action of the machinery.</p>
<p>A rudder has been seen floating off Southwark. It has a piece of
rope attached to it. Lloyd&rsquo;s people have not been down to
look at it. This shameful neglect has occasioned much conversation
in fresh-water circles, and shows an apathy which it is frightful
to contemplate.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Normandy, we perceive, has been making some

<h2>CHRISTIANITY.&mdash;PRICE FIFTEEN SHILLINGS.</h2>
<p>The English poor have tender teachers. In the first place, the
genius of Money, by a hundred direct and indirect lessons, preaches
to them the infamy of destitution; thereby softening their hearts
to a sweet humility with a strong sense of their wickedness. Then
comes Law, with its whips and bonds, to chastise and tie up
&ldquo;the offending Adam&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the Adam without a
pocket,&mdash;and then the gentle violence of kindly Mother Church
leads the poor man far from the fatal presence of his Gorgon wants,
to consort him with meek-eyed Charity,&mdash;to give him glimpses
of the Land of Promise,&mdash;to make him hear the rippling waters
of Eternal Truth,&mdash;to feast his senses with the odours of
Eternal sweets. Happy English poor! Ye are not scurfed with the
vanities of the flesh! Under the affectionate discipline of the
British Magi L.S.D.,&mdash;the &ldquo;three kings&rdquo; tasking
human muscles, banqueting on human heartstrings,&mdash;ye are
happily rescued from any visitation of those worldly comforts that
hold the weakness of humanity to life! Hence, by the benevolence of
those who have only solid acres, ye are permitted to have an
unlimited portion of the sky; and banned by the mundane ones who
have wine in their cellars, and venison in the larder from the
gross diet of beer and beef&mdash;ye are permitted to take your
bellyful of the savoury food cooked for the Hebrew patriarch. Once
a week, at least, ye are invited to feast with Joseph in the house
of Pharaoh, and yet, stiff-necked generation that ye are, ye stay
from the banquet and then complain of hunger! &ldquo;Shall there be
no punishment for this obduracy?&rdquo; asks kindly Mother Church,
her eyes red with weeping for the hard-heartedness of her children.
&ldquo;Shall there be no remedy?&rdquo; she sobs, wringing her
hands. Whereupon, the spotless maiden Law&mdash;that Amazonian
virgin, eldest child of violated Justice&mdash;answers,
&ldquo;<em>Fifteen Shillings!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are indebted to Lord BROUGHAM for this new instance of the
stubbornness of the poor&mdash;for this new revelation of the pious
vengeance of offended law. A few nights since his lordship, in a
motion touching prison discipline, stated that &ldquo;a man had
been confined for <em>ten weeks</em>, having been fined a shilling,
and <em>fourteen shillings costs</em>, which he did not pay,
because he was absent one Sunday from church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can doubt, that from the moment <em>John
Jones</em>&mdash;(the reader may christen the offender as he
pleases)&mdash;was discharged, he became a most pious, church-going
Christian? He had been ten Sundays in prison, be it remembered; and
had therefore heard at least ten sermons. He crossed the prison
threshold a new-made man; and wending towards his happy home, had
in his face&mdash;so lately smirched with shameless vice&mdash;such
lustrous glory, that even his dearest creditors failed to recognise
him!</p>
<p>Beautiful is the village church of Phariseefield! Beautiful is
its antiquity&mdash;beautiful its porch, thronged with white-headed
men and ruddy little ones! Beautiful the graves, sown with immortal
seed, clustering round the building! Beautiful the vicar&rsquo;s
horses&mdash;the vicar himself preaches to-day,&mdash;and very
beautiful indeed, the faces, ay, and the bonnets, too, of the
vicar&rsquo;s daughters! Beautiful the sound of the bell that
summons the lowly Christian to cast aside the pomps and vanities of
the world, and to stand for a time in utter nakedness of heart
before his Maker,&mdash;and very beautiful the silk stockings of
the Dowager Lady Canaan&rsquo;s footman, who carrieth with Sabbath
humility his Lady&rsquo;s books to Church! Yet all this beauty is
as deformity to the new-born loveliness of <em>John Jones</em>;
who, on the furthermost seat&mdash;far from the vain convenience of
pew and velvet hassock&mdash;sits, and inwardly blesses the one
shilling and fourteen shillings costs, that with more than
fifteen-horse power have drawn him from the iniquities of the
Jerry-shop and hustle-farthing,&mdash;to feed upon the manna
dropping from the lips of the Reverend Doctor FAT! There sits
<em>John Jones</em>, late drunkard, poacher, reprobate; but now,
fined into Christian goodness&mdash;made a very saint, according to
Act of Parliament!</p>
<p>If Mother Church, with the rods of spikenard which the law hath
benevolently placed in her hands, will but whip her truant children
to their Sunday seats,&mdash;will only consent to draw them through
the bars of a prison to their Sabbath sittings,&mdash;will teach
them the real value of Christianity, it being according to her own
estimate&mdash;<em>with the expenses</em>&mdash;exactly fifteen
shillings,&mdash;sure we are, that Radicalism and Chartism, and all
the many foul pustules that, in the conviction of Holy Church, are
at this moment poisoning and enervating the social body, will
disappear beneath the precious ointment always at her touch.</p>
<p>When we consider the many and impartial blessings scattered upon
the poor of England&mdash;when in fact we consider the beautiful
justice pervading our whole social intercourse&mdash;when we
reflect upon the spirit of good-will and sincerity that operates on
the hearts of the powerful few for the comfort and happiness of the
helpless million,&mdash;we are almost aghast at the infidelity of
poverty, forgetting in our momentary indignation, that poverty must
necessarily combine within itself every species of infamy.</p>
<p>Poor men of England, consider not merely the fine and the
expenses attendant upon absence from church, but reflect upon the
want of that beautiful exercise of the spirit which, listening to
precepts and parables in Holy Writ, delights to find for them
practical illustrations in the political and social world about
you. We know you would not think of going to church in
masquerade&mdash;of reading certain lines and making certain
responses as a bit of Sabbath ceremony, as necessary to a
respectable appearance as a Sabbath shaving. No; you are far away
from the elegances of hypocrisy, and do not time your religion from
eleven till one, making devotion a matter of the church clock. By
no means. You go to hear, it may be, the Bishop of EXETER; and as
we have premised, what a beautiful exercise for the intellect to
discover in the political doings of his Grace&mdash;in those acts
which ultimately knock at your cupboard-doors&mdash;only a
practical illustration of the divine precept of doing unto all men
as ye would they should do unto you! Well, you pray for your daily
bread; and with a profane thought of the price of the four pound
loaf, your feelings are suddenly attuned to gratitude towards those
who regulate the price of British corn. We might run through the
Scriptures from Genesis to Revelation, quoting a thousand
benevolences illustrated by the rich and mighty of this
land&mdash;illustrated politically, socially, and morally, in their
conduct towards the poor and destitute of Britain; and yet the
stiffnecked pauper will not dispose his Sabbath to
self-enjoyment&mdash;will not go to church to be rejoiced! By such
disobedience, one would almost think that the poor were wicked
enough to consider the church discipline of the Sabbath as no more
than a ceremonious mockery of their six days wants and
wretchedness.</p>
<p>The magistrates&mdash;(would we knew their names, we would hang
them up in the highways like the golden bracelets of
yore)&mdash;who have made <em>John Jones</em> religious through his
pocket, are men of comprehensive genius. There is no wickedness
that they would not make profitable to the Church. Hence, it
appears from Lord BROUGHAM&rsquo;S speech that <em>John Jones</em>
&ldquo;was guilty of <em>other excesses</em>, and had been sent to
prison for a violation of that dormant&mdash;he wished he could say
of it obsolete&mdash;law!&rdquo; There being &ldquo;other
excesses&rdquo; for which, it appears, there is no statute remedy,
the magistrates commit a piece of pious injustice, and lump sundry
laical sins into the one crime against the Church. <em>John
Jones</em>,&mdash;for who shall conceive the profanity of
man?&mdash;may have called one of these magistrates
&ldquo;goose&rdquo; or &ldquo;jackass;&rdquo; and the offence
against the justice is a contempt of the parson. After this, can
the race of <em>John Joneses</em> fail to venerate Christianity as
recommended by the Bench?</p>
<p>We have a great admiration of English Law, yet in the present
instance, we think she shares very unjustly with Mother Church. For
instance, Church in its meekness, says to <em>John Jones</em>,
&ldquo;You come not to my house on Sunday: pay a shilling.&rdquo;
<em>John Jones</em> refuses. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaims
Law&mdash;&ldquo;refuse the modest request of my pious sister?
Refuse to give her a little shilling! Give me
<em>fourteen</em>.&rdquo; Hence, in this Christian country, law is
of fourteen times the consequence of religion.</p>
<p>Applauding as we do the efforts of the magistrates quoted by
Lord BROUGHAM in the cause of Christianity, we yet conscientiously
think their system capable of improvement. When the Rustic Police
shall be properly established, we think they should be empowered to
seize upon all suspected non-church goers every Saturday night,
keeping them in the station-houses until Sunday morning, and then
marching them, securely handcuffed, up the middle aisle of the
parish church. &rsquo;Twould be a touching sight for Mr. PLUMPTREE,
and such hard-sweating devotees. For the benefit of old offenders,
we would also counsel a little wholesome private whipping in the
vestry.</p>

<h2>TOM CONNOR&rsquo;S DILEMMA.</h2>
<h3>A TRUE TALE.</h3>
<h3>SHOWING HOW READY WIT MAY SUPPLY THE PLACE OF READY MONEY.</h3>
<p>Tom Connor was a perfect specimen of the happy, careless,
improvident class of Irishmen who think it &ldquo;time enough to
bid the devil good morrow when they meet him,&rdquo; and whose
chief delight seems to consist in getting into all manner of
scrapes, for the mere purpose of displaying their ingenuity of
getting out of them again. Tom, at the time I knew him, had passed
the meridian of his life; &ldquo;he had,&rdquo; as he used to say
himself, &ldquo;given up battering,&rdquo; and had luckily a small
annuity fallen to him by the demise of a considerate old aunt who
had kindly popped off in the nick of time. And on this independence
Tom had retired to spend all that remained to him of a merry life
at a pleasant little sea-port town in the West of Ireland,
celebrated for its card-parties and its oyster-clubs. These latter
social meetings were held by rotation at the houses of the members
of the club, which was composed of the choicest spirits of the
town. There Doctor McFadd, relaxing the dignity of professional
reserve, condescended to play practical jokes on Corney Bryan, the
bothered exciseman; and Skinner, the attorney, repeated all Lord
Norbury&rsquo;s best puns, and night after night told how, at some
particular quarter sessions, he had himself said a better thing
than ever Norbury uttered in his life. But the soul of the club was
Tom Connor&mdash;who, by his inexhaustible fund of humorous
anecdotes and droll stories, kept the table in a roar till a late
hour in the night, or rather to an early hour in the morning.
Tom&rsquo;s stories usually related to adventures which had
happened to himself in his early days; and as he had experienced
innumerable vicissitudes of fortune, in every part of the world,
and under various characters, his narratives, though not remarkable
for their strict adherence to truth, were always distinguished by
their novelty.</p>
<p>One evening the club had met as usual, and Tom had mixed his
first tumbler of potheen punch, after &ldquo;the feast of
shells&rdquo; was over, when somebody happened to mention the name
of Edmund Kean, with the remark that he had once played in a barn
in that very town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I played in the same
company with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! you!&rdquo; exclaimed several voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; but that was when I was a strolling actor in
Clark&rsquo;s corps. We used to go the western circuit, and by that
means got the name of &lsquo;the Connaught Rangers.&rsquo; There
was a queer fellow in the company, called Ned Davis, an
honest-hearted fellow he was, as ever walked in shoe leather. Ned
and I were sworn brothers; we shared the same bed, which was often
only a &lsquo;shake-down&rsquo; in the corner of a stable, and the
same dinner, which was at times nothing better than a crust of
brown bread and a draught of Adam&rsquo;s ale. I&rsquo;ll trouble
you for the bottle, doctor. Thank you; may I never take worse stuff
from your hands. Talking of Ned Davis, I&rsquo;ll tell you, if you
have no objection of a strange adventure which befel us
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo! bravo! bravo!&rdquo; was the unanimous cry from
the members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence, gentlemen!&rdquo; said the chairman
imperatively; &ldquo;silence for Mr. Connor&rsquo;s
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem! Well then, some time about the year&mdash;never mind
the year&mdash;Ned and I were playing with the company at Loughrea;
business grew bad, and the salaries diminished with the houses,
until at last, one morning at a rehearsal, the manager informed us
that, in consequence of the depressed state of the drama in Galway,
the treasury would be closed until further notice, and that he had
come to the resolution to depart on the following morning for
Castlebar, whither he requested the company to follow him without
delay. Fancy my consternation at this unexpected announcement! I
mechanically thrust my hands into my pockets, but they were
completely untenanted. I rushed home to our lodgings, where I had
left Ned Davis; he, I knew, had received a guinea the day before,
upon which I rested my hopes of deliverance. I found him fencing
with his walking-stick with an imaginary antagonist, whom he had in
his mind pinned against a closet-door. I related to him the sudden
move the manager had made, and told him, in the most doleful voice
conceivable, that I was not possessed of a single penny. As soon as
I had finished, he dropped into a chair, and burst into a
long-continued fit of laughter, and then looked in my face with the
most provoking mock gravity, and asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done then? How are we to get out of
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that guinea which you got
yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! ho! ho!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;The guinea is
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; I exclaimed; and I felt my knees began to
shake under me. &ldquo;Gone&mdash;where&mdash;how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave it to the wife of that poor devil of a
scene-shifter who broke his arm last week; he had four children,
and they were starving. What could I do but give it to them? Had it
been ten times as much they should have had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what reply I made, but it had the effect of
producing another fit of uncontrollable laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you laugh,&rdquo; said I, rather angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the devil could help it;&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;your woe-begone countenance would make a cat
laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are in a pretty dilemma
here. We owe our landlady fifteen shillings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For which she will lay an embargo on our little
effects&mdash;three black wigs and a low-comedy pair of
breeches&mdash;this must be prevented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? never mind; but order dinner directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t awaken painful
recollections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and do as I tell you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Order
dinner&mdash;beef-steak and oyster-sauce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beef-steak! Are you mad&rdquo;&mdash;but before I could
finish the sentence, he had put on his hat and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; thought I, after he was gone,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s a devilish clever fellow, something may turn
up:&rdquo; so I ordered the beef-steaks. In less than an hour, my
friend returned with exultation in his looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done it!&rdquo; said he, slapping me on the back;
&ldquo;we shall have plenty of money to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I begged he would explain himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Briefly then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have been to the
billiard-room, and every other lounging-place about town, where I
circulated, in the most mysterious manner, a report that a
celebrated German doctor and philosopher, who had discovered the
secret of resuscitating the dead, had arrived in
Loughrea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How ridiculous!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry. This philosopher,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;is about to give positive proof that he can perform
what he professes, and it is his intention to go into the
churchyard to-night, and resuscitate a few of those who have not
been buried more than a twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what does all this nonsense
come to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you must play the philosopher in the
churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, you&rsquo;re the very figure for the
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some persuasion, and some further development of his plan,
I consented to wrap myself in an ample stage-cloak, and gliding
into the churchyard, I waited in the porch according to the
directions I had received from Ned, until near midnight, when I
issued forth, and proceeded to examine the different tombs
attentively. I was bending over one, which, by the inscription, I
perceived had been erected by &ldquo;an affectionate and
disconsolate wife, to the memory of her beloved husband,&rdquo;
when I was startled at hearing a rustling noise, and, on looking
round, to see a stout-looking woman standing beside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said she, addressing me, &ldquo;I know
what you&rsquo;re about here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my poor late husband&rsquo;s tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I mean to exercise
my art upon him first. He shall be restored to your arms this very
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow gave a faint scream&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,
doctor,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m greatly obliged to you.
Peter was the best of husbands&mdash;but he has now been dead six
months&mdash;and&mdash;I am&mdash;married again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the meeting will be rather
awkward, but you may induce your second husband to
resign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, doctor; let the poor man rest quietly, and here
is a trifle for your trouble.&rdquo; So saying, she slipped a
weighty purse into my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This alters the case,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;materially&mdash;your late husband shall never be disturbed
by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow withdrew with a profusion of acknowledgments; and
scarcely had she gone, when a young fellow, who I learned had
lately come into possession of a handsome property by the death of
an uncle, came to request me not to meddle with the deceased, who
he assured me was a shocking old curmudgeon, who never spent his
money like a gentleman. A douceur from the young chap secured the
repose of his uncle.</p>
<p>My next visitor was a weazel-faced man, who had been plagued for
twenty years by a shrew of a wife, who popped off one day from an
overdose of whiskey. He came to beseech me not to bring back his
plague to the world; and, pitying the poor man&rsquo;s case, I gave
him my promise readily, without accepting a fee.</p>
<p>By this time daylight had begun to appear, and creeping quietly
out of the churchyard, I returned to my lodgings. Ned was waiting
up for my return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What luck?&rdquo; said he, as I entered the room.</p>
<p>I showed him the fees I had received during the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that we should have
plenty of rhino to-day. Never despair, man, there are more ways out
of the wood than one: and recollect, that <em>ready wit is as good
as ready money</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>II.&mdash;THE NEW MAN.</h3>
<p>Embryology precedes the treatise on the perfect animal; it is
but right, therefore, that the new man should have our attention
before the mature student.</p>
<p>No sooner do the geese become asphyxiated by torsion of their
cervical <em>vertebrae</em>, in anticipation of Michaelmas-day; no
sooner do the pheasants feel premonitory warnings, that some
chemical combinations between charcoal, nitre, and sulphur, are
about to take place, ending in a precipitation of lead; no sooner
do the columns of the newspapers teem with advertisements of the
ensuing courses at the various schools, each one cheaper, and
offering more advantages than any of the others; the large
hospitals vaunting their extended field of practice, and the small
ones ensuring a more minute and careful investigation of disease,
than the new man purchases a large trunk and a hat-box, buys a
second-hand copy of Quain&rsquo;s Anatomy, abjures the dispensing
of his master&rsquo;s surgery in the country, and placing himself
in one of those rattling boxes denominated by courtesy second-class
carriages, enters on the career of a hospital pupil in his first
season.</p>
<p>The opening lecture introduces the new man to his companions,
and he is easily distinguished at that annual gathering of pupils,
practitioners, professors, and especially old hospital governors,
who do a good deal in the gaiter-line, and applaud the lecturer
with their umbrellas, as they sit in the front row. The new man is
known by his clothes, which incline to the prevalent fashion of the
rural districts he has quitted; and he evinces an affection for
cloth-boots, or short Wellingtons with double soles, and toes
shaped like a toad&rsquo;s mouth, a propensity which sometimes
continues throughout the career of his pupilage. He likewise takes
off his hat when he enters the dissecting-room, and thinks that
beautiful design is shown in the mechanism and structure of the
human body&mdash;an idea which gets knocked out of him at the end
of the season, when he looks upon the distribution of the nerves as
&ldquo;a blessed bore to get up, and no use to him after he has
passed.&rdquo; But at first he perpetually carries a</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/013-07.png"><img src=
"images/013-07.png" alt=
"A man reaches through a window to club a seated man." id=
"img013-07" name="img013-07" width="50%" /></a>
<p>&ldquo;DUBLIN DISSECTOR&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>under his arm; and whether he is engaged upon a subject or no,
delights to keep on his black apron, pockets, and sleeves (like a
barber dipped in a blacking-bottle), the making of which his
sisters have probably superintended in the country, and which he
thinks endows him with an air of industry and importance.</p>
<p>The new man, at first, is not a great advocate for beer; but
this dislike may possibly arise from his having been compelled to
stand two pots upon the occasion of his first dissection. After a
time, however, he gives way to the indulgence, having received the
solemn assurances of his companions that it is absolutely necessary
to preserve his health, and keep him from getting the collywobbles
in his pandenoodles&mdash;a description of which obstinate disease
he is told may be found in &ldquo;Dr. Copland&rsquo;s Medical
Dictionary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gregory&rsquo;s Practice of
Physic,&rdquo; but as to under what head the informant is
uncertain.</p>
<p>The first purchase that a new man makes in London is a gigantic
note-book, a dozen steel pens on a card, and a screw inkstand.
Furnished with these valuable adjuncts to study, he puts down every
thing he hears during the day, both in the theatre of the school
and the wards of the hospital, besides many diverting diagrams and
anecdotes which his fellow-students insert for him, until at night
he has a confused dream that the air-pump in the laboratory is
giving a party, at which various scalpels, bits of gums, wax
models, tourniquets, and f&oelig;tal skulls, are assisting as
guests&mdash;an eccentric and philosophical vision, worthy of the
brain from which it emanates. But the new man is, from his very
nature, a visionary. His breast swells with pride at the
introductory lecture, when he hears the professor descant upon the
noble science he and his companions have embarked upon; the rich
reward of watching the gradual progress of a suffering
fellow-creature to convalescence, and the insignificance of worldly
gain compared with the pure treasures of pathological knowledge;
whilst to the riper student all this resolves itself into the
truth, that three draughts, or one mixture, are respectively worth
four-and-sixpence or three shillings: that the patient should be
encouraged to take them as long as possible, and that the thrilling
delight of ushering another mortal into existence, after being up
all night, is considerably increased by the receipt of the tin for
superintending the performance; <em>i.e.</em> if you are lucky
enough to get it.</p>
<p>It is not improbable that, after a short period, the new man
will write a letter home. The substance of it will be as follows:
and the reader is requested to preserve a copy, as it may, perhaps,
be compared with another at a future period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR PARENTS,&mdash;I am happy to inform you that my
health is at present uninjured by the atmosphere of the hospital,
and that I find I am making daily progress in my studies. I have
taken a lodging in &mdash;&mdash; (Gower-place, University-street,
Little Britain, or Lant-street, as the case may be,) for which I
pay twelve shillings a week, including shoes. The mistress of the
house is a pious old lady, and I am very comfortable, with the
exception that two pupils live on the floor above me, who are
continually giving harmonic parties to their friends, and I am
sometimes compelled to request they will allow me to conclude
transcribing my lecture notes in tranquillity&mdash;a request, I am
sorry to say, not often complied with. The smoke from their pipes
fills the whole house, and the other night they knocked me up two
hours after I had retired to rest, for the loan of the jug of cold
water from my washhand-stand, to make grog with, and a
&lsquo;Little Warbler,&rsquo; if I had one, with the words of
&lsquo;The Literary Dustman&rsquo; in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Independently of these annoyances, I get on pretty well,
and have already attracted the notice of my professors, who return
my salutation very condescendingly, and tell me to look upon them
rather as friends than teachers. The students here, generally
speaking, are a dissipated and irreligious set of young men; and I
can assure you I am often compelled to listen to language that
quite makes my ears tingle. I have found a very decent washerwoman,
who mends for me as well; but, unfortunately, she washes for the
house, and the initials of one of the students above me are the
same as mine, so that I find our things are gradually changing
hands, in which I have the worst, because his shirts and socks are
somewhat dilapidated, or, to speak professionally, their fibrous
texture abounds in organic lesions; and the worst is, he never
finds out the error until the end of the week, when he sends my
things back, with his compliments, and thinks the washerwoman has
made a mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been to the theatres yet, nor do I feel the
least wish to enter into any of the frivolities of the great
metropolis. With kind regards to all at home, believe me,</p>
<p class="rgt">&ldquo;Your&rsquo;s affectionately,<br />
&ldquo;JOSEPH MUFF.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>&ldquo;I DO ADJURE YE, ANSWER ME!&rdquo;</h3>
<p>A valuable porcelain vase, which stood in one of the state rooms
of Windsor Castle, has been recently broken; it is suspected by
design, as the situation in which it was placed almost precludes
the idea that it could have happened by accident. A commission,
called &ldquo;The Flunky Inquisition,&rdquo; has been appointed by
Sir Robert Peel, with Sibthorp at its head, to inquire into the
affair. The gallant Colonel declares that he has personally
cross-examined all the housemaids, but that he has hitherto been
unable to obtain a satisfactory solution of</p>

<h2>INQUEST EXTRAORDINARY ON A CORONER.</h2>
<p>Last night an inquest was held on the <em>Consistency</em> of
Thomas Wakley, Esq., Member for Finsbury, and Coroner for
Middlesex. The deceased had been some time ailing, but his demise
was at length so sudden, that it was deemed necessary to public
justice that an inquest should be taken of the unfortunate
remains.</p>
<p>The inquest was held at the Vicar of Bray tap, Palace Yard; and
the jury, considering the neighbourhood, was tolerably respectable.
The remains of the deceased were in a dreadful state of
decomposition; and although chloride of lime and other antiseptic
fluids were plentifully scattered in the room, it was felt to be a
service of danger to approach too closely to the defunct. Many
members of Parliament were in attendance, and all of them, to a
man, appeared very visibly shocked by the appearance of the body.
Indeed they all of them seemed to gather a great moral lesson from
the corpse. &ldquo;We know not whose turn it may be next,&rdquo;
was printed in the largest physiognomical type in every
member&rsquo;s countenance.</p>
<p>Thomas Duncombe, Esq., Member for Finsbury, examined&mdash;Had
known the deceased for some years. Had the highest notion of the
robustness of his constitution. Would have taken any odds upon it.
Deceased, however, within these last three or four weeks had
flighty intervals. Talked very much about the fine phrenological
development of Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s skull. Had suspicions of the
deceased from that moment. Deceased had been carefully watched, but
to no avail. Deceased inflicted a mortal wound upon himself on the
first night of Sir Robert&rsquo;s premiership; and though he
continued to rally for many evenings, he sunk the night before
last, after a dying speech of twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Colonel Sibthorp, Member for Lincoln, examined&mdash;Knew the
deceased. Since the accession of Sir Robert Peel to power had had
many conversations with the deceased upon the ministerial bench.
Had offered snuff-box to the deceased. Deceased did not snuff.
Deceased had said that he thought witness a man of high
parliamentary genius, and that Sir Robert Peel ought to have made
him (witness) either Lord Chamberlain or Chancellor of the
Exchequer. In every other respect, deceased behaved himself quite
rationally.</p>
<p>There were at least twenty other witnesses&mdash;Members of the
House of Commons&mdash;in attendance to be examined; but the
Coroner put it to the jury whether they had not heard enough?</p>
<p>The jury assented, and immediately returned a
verdict&mdash;<em>Felo de se</em>.</p>
<p>N.B. A member for Finsbury wanted next dissolution.</p>

<h3>A CURIOUS ERROR.</h3>
<p>A member of the American legislature, remarkable for his absence

mistake until he was</p>

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>DIE HEXEN AM RHEIN; OR, RUDOLPH OF HAPSBURGH.</h3>
<p>Mysterious are thy ways, O Yates! Thou art the only true
melodramatist of the stage and off the stage! When a new demonology
is compiled thou shalt have an honourable place in it. Thou shall
be worshipped as the demon of novelty, even by the
&ldquo;gods&rdquo; themselves. Thy deeds shall be recorded in
history. It shall not be forgotten that thou wert the importer of
Mademoiselle Djeck, the tame elephant; of Monsieur Bohain, the
gigantic Irishman; and of Signor Hervi o&rsquo;Nano, the
Cockneyan-Italian dwarf. Never should we have seen the Bayaderes
but for you; nor T.P. Cooke in &ldquo;The Pilot,&rdquo; nor the
Bedouin Arabs, nor &ldquo;The Wreck Ashore,&rdquo; nor
&ldquo;bathing and sporting&rdquo; nymphs, nor other dramatic
delicacies. Truly, thou art the luckiest of managers; for all thy
efforts succeed, whether they deserve it or not. Sometimes thou
drawest up an army of scene-painters, mechanists, dancers,
monsters, dwarfs, devils, fire-works, and water-spouts, in terrible
array against common sense. Yet lo! thou dost conquer! Thy pieces
never miss fire; they go on well with the public, and favourable
are the press reports. Wert thou a Catholic thou wouldest be
canonised; for evil spirits are thy passion; the Vatican itself
cannot produce a more indefatigable &ldquo;devils&rsquo;
advocate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The repast now provided by Mr. Yates for those who are fond of
&ldquo;supping full of horrors&rdquo; is a devilled drama,
interspersed with hydraulics&mdash; consisting, in fact, of spirits
and water, sweetened with songs and spiced with witches. It is, we
are informed by the official announcements, &ldquo;a romantic
burletta of witchcraft, in two acts, and a prologue, with entirely
new scenery, dresses, and peculiar appointments, <em>imagined</em>
by, and introduced under the direction of, Mr. Yates.&rdquo; Now,
any person, entirely unprejudiced with a taste for devilry and free
from hydrophobia, who sees this production, must have an unbounded
opinion of the manager&rsquo;s imagination,&mdash;what a head he
must have for aquatic effects! In vain we look around for its
parallel&mdash;nothing but the New River head suggests itself.</p>
<p>But our preface is detaining us from the &ldquo;prologue;&rdquo;
the first words in which stamp the entire production with
originality. Assassins, who let themselves out by the job, have
long been pleasantly employed in melodramas, being mostly enacted
by performers in the heavy line; but the author of &ldquo;Die Hexen
am Rhein&rdquo; introduces a character hitherto unknown to the
stage; namely, the <em>comic</em> cut-throat. Messieurs
<em>Gabor</em> and <em>Wolfstein</em>, (played by Mr. Wright, and
the immortal <em>Geoffery Muffincap</em>, Mr. Wilkinson), treat us
with a dialogue concerning the blowing out of brains, and the
incision of weasands, which is conceived and delivered with the
broadest humour, enlivened by the choicest of jokes. They have, we
learn, been lately commissioned by <em>Ottocar</em> to murder
<em>Rudolph</em>, the exiled Duke of Hapsburgh, who is to pass that
way; but he does not come, because his kind kinsman,
<em>Ottocar</em>, must have time to consult the god-fathers and
god-mothers of the piece, or &ldquo;Witches of the Rhine;&rdquo;
which he does in the &ldquo;storm-reft hut of Zabaren.&rdquo; This
<em>Zabaren</em> is a hospitable gentleman, who sings a good song,
sees much company, and is played by that convivial genius Paul
Bedford. <em>Ottocar</em> is introduced amongst other friends to a
&ldquo;speaking spirit,&rdquo; who, being personated by Miss
Terrey, utters a terrible prediction. We could not quite make out
the purport of this augury; nor were we much grieved at the loss;
feeling assured that the next two acts would be occupied in
fulfilling it. The funny bravoes present themselves in the next
scene, and exit to stab one of two brothers, who goes off evidently
for that purpose, judiciously coming back to die in the arms of
<em>Count Rudolph</em>, for whom he has been mistaken. Under such
circumstances it is but fair that the prince should repay the
obligation he owes his friend for being killed in his stead, by
promising protection to the widow and child. The oath he takes
would be doubly binding (for he promises to become a brother to the
wife, and not content with thus making himself the child&rsquo;s
uncle, swears to be his father too), if the husband did not die
before he has had time to utter his wife&rsquo;s name. All these
affairs having been settled, the prologue&mdash;which used to be
called the first act&mdash;ends.</p>
<p>Fifteen years are supposed to elapse before the curtain is again
rolled up; and that this allusion may be rendered the more perfect,
the audience is kept waiting about three times fifteen minutes, to
amuse one another during the <em>entr&rsquo;acte</em>. We next
learn that <em>Rudolph</em> is seated upon his ducal throne,
fortunate in the possession of a paragon-wife, and a steward of the
household not to be equalled&mdash;no other than
<em>Ottocar</em>&mdash;that particular friend, who, in the
prologue, tried to get a finis put to his mortal career. The jocose
ruffians here enliven the scene&mdash;one by being cast into a
dungeon for asking <em>Ottocar</em> (evidently the Colburn of his
day), an exorbitant price for the copyright of a certain
manuscript; the other, by calling the courtier a man of genius, and
being taken into his service, as no doubt, &ldquo;first
robber.&rdquo; To support this character, a change of apparel is
necessary: and no wonder, for <em>Wolfstein</em> has on precisely
the same clothes he wore fifteen years before.</p>
<p>His first job is to steal a casket; but is declined, probably,
because <em>Wolfstein</em>, being a professor of the capital crime,
considers mere larceny <em>infra dig</em>. A &ldquo;second
robber&rdquo; must therefore be hired, and <em>Ottocar</em> has one
already preserved in the castle dungeons, in the person of a dumb
prisoner. Dummy comes on, and the auditors at once recognise the
&ldquo;brother&rdquo; who was not murdered in the prologue. He
steals the casket, and <em>Ottocar</em> steals off.</p>
<p>The duke and duchess next enter into a dialogue, the subject of
which is one <em>Wilhelm</em>, a young standard-bearer, who
appears; and having said a few words exits, that <em>Ida</em>, the
duchess, might inform us, in a soliloquy, what we have already
shrewdly suspected, namely&mdash;that the ensign is her son;
another presentiment comes into one&rsquo;s mind, which one
don&rsquo;t think it fair to the author and his story to entertain
till the proper time. A sort of secret interview between the mother
and son now takes place, which ends by the imprisonment of the
latter; why is not explained at the moment; nor, indeed, till the
next scene, when it is quite apparent; for if one sees an
impregnable castle, rigidly guarded by supernumeraries, with an
impassable river, bristling with <em>chevaux-de-frise</em> it is
impossible to get over, and a moat that it would be death to cross,
a prison-escape may be surely calculated upon. In the present
instance, this formulary is not omitted, for <em>Wilhelm</em> jumps
into the river from a bridge which he has contrived to reach.
Though several shots are fired into the tank of water that
represents the Rhine, there is no hissing; on the contrary, the
second act ends amidst general applause; which indeed it deserves,
for the scenery is magnificent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ancient Arch in the Black Forest,&rdquo; is a sort of
house of call for witches, and it being seen during their
merry-making, or holiday, is rendered more picturesque by the
<em>Devil&rsquo;s</em> &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; The hospitable
<em>Zabaren</em> entertains hundreds of witches, of all sorts and
sizes, who dance all manner of country-dances, and sing a series of
songs and choruses, in which the &ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; is again
conspicuously introduced. It seems that German witches not only
ride upon brooms, but sweep with them; and a company of
supernatural Jack Rags perform sundry gyrations peculiarly
interesting to housemaids. After about an hour&rsquo;s dancing, the
witches being naturally &ldquo;blown,&rdquo; are just in cue for
leaving off with an airy dance called the &ldquo;witches&rsquo;
whirlwind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This episode over, the plot goes on. <em>Ottocar</em> accuses
<em>Ida</em> of infidelity with <em>Wilhelm</em> to the duke; she,
in explanation, fulfils the presentiment we had some delicacy in
hinting too soon&mdash;that she is the wife of the man who was
killed in the prologue; <em>Rudolph</em> having married her in
ignorance of that fact, and by a coincidence which, though
intensely melo-dramatic, every body foresees who has ever been
three times to the Adelphi theatre.</p>
<p>To describe the last scene would be the height of presumption in
PUNCH. Nobody but &ldquo;Satan&rdquo; Montgomery, or the Adelphi
play-bill, is equal to the task. We quote, as preferable, the
latter authority:&mdash;&ldquo;Grand inauguration of
<em>Wilhelm</em>, the rightful heir. CORAL CAVES and CRYSTAL
STREAMS: these are actually obtained by a HYDRO-SCENIC EFFECT! As
the usual area devoted to illusion becomes a reality!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides all this, which simply means &ldquo;real water,&rdquo;
there is a <em>Neptune</em> in a car drawn by three sea or
ichthyological horses, having fins and web feet. There is a devil
that is seen through the whole piece, because he is supposed to be
invisible (cleverly played by Mr. Wieland), and who having dived
into the water, is fished out of it, and sent flying into the
flies. This sending a devil upward, is a new way of</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/013-12.png"><img src=

"An artist paints a portrait of a black man." id="img013-12" name=
"img013-12" width="50%" /></a>
<p>TAKING OFF THE DARK GENTLEMAN.</p>
</div>
<p>Being dripping wet, the demon in his ascent seriously incommodes
<em>Neptune</em>; who, not being used to the water, looks about in
great distress, evidently for an umbrella. After several glares of
several coloured fires, the curtain falls.</p>
<p>Seriously, the scenic effects of this piece do great credit to
Mr. Yates&rsquo;s &ldquo;imagination,&rdquo; and to the handiwork
of his &ldquo;own peculiar artists.&rdquo; It is very proper that
they should be immortalised in the advertisements; by which the
public are informed that the scenery is by Pitt, (where is
Tomkins?) and others: the machinery by Mr. Hayley, and the
<em>lightning</em> by the direction of Mr. Outhwaite! Bat will the
public be satisfied with such scanty information? Who, they will
ask the manager, rolls the thunder? who supplies the coloured
fires? who flashes the lightning? who beats the gong? who grinds up
the curtain? Let Mr. Yates be speedy in relieving the breathless
curiosity of his patrons on these points, or look to his
benches.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
